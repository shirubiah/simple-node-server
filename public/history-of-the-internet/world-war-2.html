			        There was no Internet during WWII BUT the concept of "maze of materials" or linked documents that is the building core of web pages 
			        has already been thought of and discussed during those years.</p>

			        Vannevar Bush was never directly involved with the creation or development of the Internet. He died before the creation of the World 
			        Wide Web. Yet many consider Bush to be the Godfather of our wired age often making reference to his 1945 essay, "As We May Think." In
			        his article, Bush described a theoretical machine he called a "memex," which was to enhance human memory by allowing the user to store
			        and retrieve documents linked by associations. This associative linking was very similar to what is known today as hypertext. Indeed,
			        Ted Nelson who later did pioneering work with hypertext credited Bush as his main influence (Zachary, 399). Others, such as J.C.R. 
			        Licklider and Douglas Engelbart have also paid homage to Bush.</p>

                    Bush's innovative idea for automating human memory was obviously important in the development digital age, but even more important was
                    his influence on the institution of science in America. His work to create a relationship between the government and the scientific 
                    establishment during WWII changed the way scientific research is carried on in the U.S. and fostered the environment in which the 
                    Internet was later created.</p>

			        <strong>World War II</strong></p>

                    <p id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The U.S. was not prepared for the second world war. Little was spent on military research. The military research that was done was done 
                    by military personnel and often duplicated between the different branches. The military looked down on engineers as little more than 
                    salesmen. By 1940, Bush and other American scientists felt that the country needed a new organization to conduct military research. 
                    Scientists and the government/military, as well as business would need to cooperate in the event of American involvement in the war.</p>
                    

                    <p id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    On June 12, 1940, Bush met with President Roosevelt and detailed his plan for mobilizing military research. He proposed a new 
                    organization he called the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). The committee would bring together government, military, 
                    business, and scientific leaders to coordinate military research. Roosevelt quickly agreed and thus the NDRC was created. Bush was 
                    made chairman and given a direct line to the White House. In mid-1941, The Office of Scientific Research and Development was set up. 
                    The NDRC had been funded by presidential emergency funds and was often short on money. The OSRD was congressionally funded. The NDRC 
                    was subsumed under the OSRD as its chief operating unit. Bush became director of the OSRD.</p>

                    <p id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The NDRC and then the OSRD were originally set up to support and augment Army and Navy research, but by the end of the war the OSRD was
                    leading military research. Many useful innovations resulted from OSRD research and development including improvements in radar, the 
                    proximity fuse, anti-submarine tactics, and various secret devices for the OSS (the precursor of the CIA). Bush was also very closely
                    involved in the Manhattan Project which developed the first atomic bomb. Of course most of OSRD's work was top secret during the war, 
                    but Bush as its leader became something of a celebrity. Colliers magazine hailed him as the "man who may win or lose the war".</p>

                    <p id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Bush's work with the NDRC and OSRD definitely helped the U.S. and its allies win the war. Bush also changed the way basic scientific 
                    research was done in the U.S. He proved that technology was key to winning a war and this created a new respect for scientists. He 
                    institutionalized the relationship between government, business, and the scientific community. Paul Ceruzzi, curator of the 
                    Smithsonian Institutions says, " Bush is responsible for the whole architecture of government support for science" (Ceruzzi in Zachary).
                    It was this government support of research that would later foster the creation of the Internet.</p>
