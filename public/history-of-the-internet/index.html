			        The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before. The invention of the telegraph,telephone, 
			        radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting
			        capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their 
			        computers without regard for geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of 
			        sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in 
			        packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology.</p>

			        The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global
			        or Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects - technological, organizational, and 
			        community. And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer communications but throughout society as we move 
			        toward increasing use of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition, and community operations.</p>
