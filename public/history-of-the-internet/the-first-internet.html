			        1. The technology behind the Internet began back in the 1960’s at MIT. The first message ever to be transmitted was LOG.. why? The user
			        had attempted to type LOGIN, but the network crashed after the enormous load of data of the letter G. It was to be a while before 
			        Facebook would be developed.</p>
			        
			        <p id="text">
			        2. The Internet began as a single page at the URL http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html, which contained 
			        information about this new-fangled “WorldWideWeb” project, and how you too could make a hypertext page full of wonderful hyperlinks.</p>

			        3. The first emoticon is commonly credited to Kevin Mackenzie in 1979, but was a rather simple <strong>-)</strong> and didn’t really look
			        like a face. 3 years later, <strong>:-)</strong> was proposed by Scott Fahlman and has become the norm.</p>

			        4. The first webcam was deployed at Cambridge University computer lab – its sole purpose to monitor a particular coffee maker
			        and hence avoid wasted trips to an empty pot.</p>

			        5. Although the MP3 standard was invented in 1991, it wouldn’t be until 1998 that the first music file-sharing service Napster, 
			        would go live, and change the way the Internet was used forever.</p>
			        
			        <p id="text">
			         6. The first ever banner ad invaded the Internet in 1994, and it was just as bad as today. The ad was part of AT&Ts “you will” 
			         campaign, and was placed on the HotWired homepage.

			         7. The very first spam email was sent in 1978, when DEC released a new computer and operating system, and an innovative DEC marketeer 
			         decided to send a mass email to 600 users and administrators of the ARPANET (the precursor of the Internet). The poor sap who had typed
			         it all in didn’t quite understand the system, and ended up typing the addresses first into the SUBJECT:, which then overflowed into the 
			         TO: field, the CC: field, and finally the email body too! The reaction of the recipients was much the same fury as users today. It 
			         wasn’t until later though that the term “spam” would be born.

			         8. The very first thing bought off from the Internet is a pizza.
