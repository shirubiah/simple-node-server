        <h1>Then, Now, and Tomorrow</h1>
        
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"><img src="images/baby.jpg" alt="baby photo"/></a> <p>When I was a kid, I was preoccupied with drawing. I drew all over our dictionaries and almanacs at home. I spent the entire class hours drawing on my notebooks and not listening to a word the 
        teacher says. I drew with my sisters and brothers. Even as I lie in bed, I draw imaginary figures in the air with my fingers. I was also very into dancing and singing. According to my parents, 
        whenever they play music in the stereo or from a radio, I immediately sway and shake and mumble along with the song.</p>
        
        <a href="http://simple-node-server-shirubiah.c9.io/html-exercises/text-formatting-1.html"><img src="images/HS.jpg" alt="highshool photo"/></a> <p>When I got in highschool, things got pretty serious and I grew out my playful stage. I focused more on studying and was able to excel in our class. I spent my vacant hours burried in books in 
        the library. I never got into sports because I was so bad at it, and instead joined academic competitions outside of school. I never experienced the dating and flirting thing during highschool 
        because I was so preoccupied in improving my grades. Watching cartoons and anime was my sole form of entertainment. I became book smart with the maturity of a 6 year old.</p>
        
        <a href="http://simple-node-server-shirubiah.c9.io/html-exercises/images-1.html"><img src="images/now.jpg" alt="current photo"/></a> <p>Now I am now in my final year in college. As I remember my days in elementary and highschool, I realized that things have been drastically different. I am no longer book smart, but I now have the 
        maturity of a 20[-something] year old person. I no longer draw and sing, but I still dance. I no longer excel in class, but I continue on learning and pushing my limits. I have experienced dating 
        flirting, and realized fairytales, animes, and movies are a load of bull. I am wiser and stupider in a lot of ways, but I keep on striving and moving forward.</p>
        
        <a href="http://google.com.ph/"> <img src="images/future.jpg" alt="future me"/></a> <p>I imagine myself as a sucessful career woman in a few years. I also picture myself as a polyglot, being able to communicate with a lot of people while travelling to different countries. I'm 
        also considering the possibility of getting into law school, and hopefully becoming a sucessful practitioner of law in the future.</p>
