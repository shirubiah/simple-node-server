        <h2>Tintin's Top Picks</h2>
        
        <em>My Top 3 Movie Picks</em><br>
        <p>For people who are into food, animations, and easter eggs (hidden images or events animators insert within their films), I recommend <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844471/">Cloudy With A Chance
        of Meatballs</a>. Not only is it funny, but its also very detailed in a way that the simulation of food is so much similar to real life. Each character were carefully made--even the villagers has their
        own role and movements. I think this is one of the most aesthetically excellent animated films there is.</p>
        
        <p>My next top movie would be <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight Club</a>. Words like action, suspense, psychological, neo-noir and others won't even cover the exact feel of this 
        film. What I really liked about this film is again the details that most of people would usually overlook and would only be noticeable upon numerous replays. It's a mind-fugging movie that has a lot of 
        unanswered questions that will leave you frustrated in the end.</p>
        
        <p>My final top movie pick would be <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2245084/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Big Hero 6</a>. I liked this movie primarily because its main <abbr title="Official Sound Track">OST 
        </abbr> is from Fall Out Boy, my all-time favorite band. I also liked the futiristic fusion of San Francisco and Tokyo in this film. Plus, who wouldn't like the adorable Baymax
        ?</p>

        <em>The Top 3 Songs of my Current Playlist</em><br>
        
        <p>I had to put in the word <q>current</q> because I constantly change the top songs in my playlist, depending on my mood. I usually have newly downloaded songs as my top songs. And as of the moment, 
        Charlie Puth's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igNVdlXhKcI">Marvin Gaye</a> featuring Meghan Trainor fills the top 1 spot in my playlist. I like the contrast of the suggestive lyrics with the 
        light upbeat backdrop instrumentals. This song never fails to put me in a good mood.</p>
        
        <p>The next song in my playlist would be My Chemical Romance's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDWgsQhbaqU">Welcome to the Black Parade</a>. I'm kind of into singers who could belt out a raspy, 
        almost screamo kind of songs, and Gerard Way (frontman) is the perfect example. I have been in an MCR kind of feels recently, and I have been watching and replaying a lot of music videos. Which brings 
        me to my next and last top song in my playlist.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCCyoocDxBA">Helena</a> again by My Chemical Romance pretty much sums up my highschool feels. Contrary to popular belief that MCR is <q>emo</q>, they are 
        actually one of the most artisitic and skillful band there is. In this music video, they portrayed another side of death and funerals which is surprisingly beautiful and elegant. I play this along 
        with other MCR songs (I would probably be stuck in this playlist for the following weeks to come.</p>
