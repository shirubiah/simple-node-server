        <h1> The Tintin Ronolo</h1>
        
        <p> My name is <strong>Sylvia Christine M. Ronolo</strong>, but nobody really calls me Sylvia or Christine. They call me <emphasized>Tintin</emphasized> instead. I was born in February 16, 1993 at Batangas City,
        Philippines. I am a full-blooded Filipino but my heart and mind belongs to the different countries of the world. I love learning foreign languages, culture, and traditions and I dream of 
        being able to travel around the world.</p>

        <p> I spent my highschool years in <abbr title="Carmel School of Batangas">CSB</abbr> and pursued BA Communication Arts latter on at <abbr title="University of the Philippines Los Banos">UPLB</abbr>.
        I like quite a lot of books. Some of my favorite books would be the <cite>Harry Potter Series</cite> by JK Rowling, <cite>An Abundance of Katherines</cite> by John Green, <cite>Boy Meets Boy</cite> by David
        Levithan, <cite>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</cite> by Roald Dahl, <cite>13 Reasons Why</cite> by Jay Asher, and <cite>The Bell Jar</cite> by Sylvia Plath.</p>
        
        <p> I remember the time we were given a project of lettering any quotation we like, and I immediately looked for quotations from Mark Twain (don't quite remember why I specifically wanted Twain). 
        I chose his quotation <q>Be good and you will be lonesome.</q> which I found profound and very intgriguing. It was short, simple, yet it has quite an impact. I still think of that quotation from time to 
        time.</p>
