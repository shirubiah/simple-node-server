                Johnny was a chemist&#39;s son <br/>
                His head stuffed full of brains <br/>
                While Johnny&#39;s thoughts were rocket ships, <br/>
                Other kids&#39; thoughts were trains

                Johnny&#39;s father noticed Johnny <br/>
                Seldom saw the light of day <br/>
                So Johnny&#39;s father pushed pale Johnny <br/>
                Out into the sun to play.

                Johnny couldn&#39;t swing a bat <br/>
                Johnny couldn&#39;t catch a ball <br/>
                Science was his life-long love <br/>
                His home, the lecture hall

                I need some time to think. <br/>
                Besides, the sun is parching me, <br/>
                And I think I need a drink!"
