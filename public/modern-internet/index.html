    the massive growth and increase in significance of the Internet in the daily lives of people around the world.</p>

    <p>The number of Internet users has skyrocketed from only 738 million in the year 2000 to 3.2 billion users this year, with Internet penetration 
    increasing almost seven times from 6.3 percent to 43 percent of the world population over the same period.</p>
    
    <p>Of the 3.2 billion people that are connected to the Internet, the ITU report reveals that most of the users, specifically about 2 billion people,
